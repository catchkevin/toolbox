git diff
(The "What did I actually change?" tool)

Before you even run your script, you might forget exactly what lines of code you edited.
What it does: Shows the exact line-by-line changes in your files that haven't been staged yet.

Why use it: It’s a great "sanity check" to make sure you didn't leave a console.log or a password in your code before committing.
